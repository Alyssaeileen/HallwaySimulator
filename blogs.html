        OMG this game changed my life.  I have been playing non stop! I am addicted to this game. All day I sit on the couch playing this game and get fat on cheetos. This game helped me take my mind off of my hedgehog's tragic accident.

        THIS IS THE WORST!!!!! MY GRANDMA JUST BEAT ME!!!. I GOT IT FOR CHRISTMAS AND EVERYTHING, I LOVED PLAYING THIS GAME IT REALLY FRIED MY POTATOES, TOASTED MY BUNS AS THE PEOPLE SAY THESE DAYS. THE GAME ISN’T CHALLENGING BUT IT WAS MY LAST MEMORY OF MY DEAD BROTHER WHO DIED THE CHRISTMAS I GOT IT. But anyways aside from that whole spiel I would definitely recommend this game to others who are looking for a fun 2d game to play. Personally I find playing this game most enjoyable silently sobbing to myself sitting on the window sill looking out at the falling snow reminiscing on the day my brother died. ANYWAYS 10/10 LOVED PLAYING THIS GAME GOT ME THROUGH MY FIRST THREE DIVORCES.
